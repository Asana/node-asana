# **getEvents**
> EventResponseArray getEvents(resource, opts)

Get events on a resource

Returns the full record for all events that have occurred since the sync token was created.  A &#x60;GET&#x60; request to the endpoint &#x60;/[path_to_resource]/events&#x60; can be made in lieu of including the resource ID in the data for the request.  Asana limits a single sync token to 100 events. If more than 100 events exist for a given resource, &#x60;has_more: true&#x60; will be returned in the response, indicating that there are more events to pull.  *Note: The resource returned will be the resource that triggered the event. This may be different from the one that the events were requested for. For example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks contained within the project.*

### Example
```javascript
const Asana = require('asana');
let defaultClient = Asana.ApiClient.instance;

// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
let oauth2 = defaultClient.authentications['oauth2'];
oauth2.accessToken = '<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>';

let apiInstance = new Asana.EventsApi();
let resource = "12345"; // String | A resource ID to subscribe to. The resource can be a task or project.
let opts = { 
  'sync': "de4774f6915eae04714ca93bb2f5ee81", // String | A sync token received from the last request, or none on first sync. Events will be returned from the point in time that the sync token was generated. *Note: On your first request, omit the sync token. The response will be the same as for an expired sync token, and will include a new valid sync token.If the sync token is too old (which may happen from time to time) the API will return a `412 Precondition Failed` error, and include a fresh sync token in the response.*
  'opt_fields': ["action","change","change.action","change.added_value","change.field","change.new_value","change.removed_value","created_at","parent","parent.name","resource","resource.name","type","user","user.name"] // [String] | This endpoint returns a compact resource, which excludes some properties by default. To include those optional properties, set this query parameter to a comma-separated list of the properties you wish to include.
};
apiInstance.getEvents(resource, opts, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
  console.error(error);
  } else {
  console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
  }
});
```
