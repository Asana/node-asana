/**
 * A _workspace_ is the highest-level organizational unit in Asana. All projects
 * and tasks have an associated workspace.
 * 
 * An _organization_ is a special kind of workspace that represents a company.
 * In an organization, you can group your projects into teams. You can read
 * more about how organizations work on the Asana Guide.
 * To tell if your workspace is an organization or not, check its
 * `is_organization` property.
 * 
 * Over time, we intend to migrate most workspaces into organizations and to
 * release more organization-specific functionality. We may eventually deprecate
 * using workspace-based APIs for organizations. Currently, and until after
 * some reasonable grace period following any further announcements, you can
 * still reference organizations in any `workspace` parameter.
