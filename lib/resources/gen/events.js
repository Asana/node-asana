/**
 * An _event_ is an object representing a change to a resource that was observed
 * by an event subscription.
 * 
 * In general, requesting events on a resource is faster and subject to higher
 * rate limits than requesting the resource itself. Additionally, change events
 * bubble up - listening to events on a project would include when stories are
 * added to tasks in the project, even on subtasks.
 * 
 * Establish an initial sync token by making a request with no sync token.
 * The response will be a `412` error - the same as if the sync token had
 * expired.
 * 
 * Subsequent requests should always provide the sync token from the immediately
 * preceding call.
 * 
 * Sync tokens may not be valid if you attempt to go 'backward' in the history
 * by requesting previous tokens, though re-requesting the current sync token
 * is generally safe, and will always return the same results.
 * 
 * When you receive a `412 Precondition Failed` error, it means that the
 * sync token is either invalid or expired. If you are attempting to keep a set
 * of data in sync, this signals you may need to re-crawl the data.
 * 
 * Sync tokens always expire after 24 hours, but may expire sooner, depending on
 * load on the service.
