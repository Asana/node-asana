/**
 * Webhooks allow an application to be notified of changes. This is in addition
 * to the ability to fetch those changes directly as
 * [Events](/developers/api-reference/events) - in fact, Webhooks are just a way
 * to receive Events via HTTP POST at the time they occur instead of polling for
 * them. For services accessible via HTTP this is often vastly more convenient,
 * and if events are not too frequent can be significantly more efficient.
 * 
 * In both cases, however, changes are represented as Event objects - refer to
 * the [Events documentation](/developers/api-reference/events) for more
 * information on what data these events contain.
 * 
 * **NOTE:** While Webhooks send arrays of Event objects to their target, the
 * Event objects themselves contain *only IDs*, rather than the actual resource
 * they are referencing. So while a normal event you receive via GET /events
 * would look like this:
 * 
 *     {\
 *       "resource": {\
 *         "id": 1337,\
 *         "resource_type": "task",\
 *         "name": "My Task"\
 *       },\
 *       "parent": null,\
 *       "created_at": "2013-08-21T18:20:37.972Z",\
 *       "user": {\
 *         "id": 1123,\
 *         "resource_type": "user",\
 *         "name": "Tom Bizarro"\
 *       },\
 *       "action": "changed",\
 *       "type": "task"\
 *     }
 * 
 * In a Webhook payload you would instead receive this:
 * 
 *     {\
 *       "resource": 1337,\
 *       "parent": null,\
 *       "created_at": "2013-08-21T18:20:37.972Z",\
 *       "user": 1123,\
 *       "action": "changed",\
 *       "type": "task"\
 *     }
 * 
 * Webhooks themselves contain only the information necessary to deliver the
 * events to the desired target as they are generated.

/**
 * Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST
 * similar to any other resource creation. Since you could have multiple
 * webhooks we recommend specifying a unique local id for each target.
 * 
 * Next comes the confirmation handshake. When a webhook is created, we will
 * send a test POST to the `target` with an `X-Hook-Secret` header as
 * described in the
 * [Resthooks Security documentation](http://resthooks.org/docs/security/).
 * The target must respond with a `200 OK` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret`
 * header to confirm that this webhook subscription is indeed expected.
 * 
 * If you do not acknowledge the webhook's confirmation handshake it will
 * fail to setup, and you will receive an error in response to your attempt
 * to create it. This means you need to be able to receive and complete the
 * webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight.
